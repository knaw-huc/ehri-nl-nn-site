On 13 July 2023, the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science submitted 
to the European Union the step 1 application for EHRI, the European Holocaust 
Research Infrastructure, to establish itself as an European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC).

"With this submission, we are well on our way towards EHRI transforming itself from 
a series of successful projects that have been running since 2010 into a permanent 
European organization that will help secure the future of trans-national Holocaust research, 
commemoration and education,” explains Dr. Reto Speck, Co-Director of EHRI.

Shortly before the Step 1 submission, the interim General Assembly (iGA) decided 
unanimously to approve all the necessary documents for this first part of the 
application process. The iGA comprises of representatives of the 11 prospective 
founding member countries of the ERIC and is the key committee that prepares and 
evaluates documentation for the process of establishing EHRI-ERIC. EHRI started as a 
project in 2010 and is now in its third phase with 27 partners in 15 European countries, 
Israel and the United States. The Dutch [NIOD](https://niod.nl) Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide 
Studies has been coordinator of the projects and the Netherlands has been chosen as the 
hosting country of the ERIC.

The European Commission will assess the Step 1 application by obtaining the views of 
independent experts. It is expected that after 3 months, EHRI will be informed of the 
results of the assessment. Taking into account necessary modifications, EHRI will then 
progress to Step 2, which is a formal request to the Commission to set up the ERIC, 
signed by all future members of the ERIC.

“After approval of the European Commission, EHRI will then be ready to establish itself as 
an ERIC,” says Reto Speck, “It is our sincere wish to launch EHRI-ERIC by January 2025, the 
80th-anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”
