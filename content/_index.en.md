The material legacy of the Second World War in the Netherlands is numerous (think of camps, 
archive and places of memory). Researchers affiliated with universities and research centers
take care of this heritage every day while also trying to come to a better understanding of this past
through both traditional and digital methods. EHRI-NL is looking for ways to bring these two worlds 
closer together and encourages collaboration within and between areas of expertise within a national,
digital Holocaust research infrastructure.
