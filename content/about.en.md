{{< intro >}}
The mission of the [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu) is to 
to ensure that the study, commemoration and education are encouraged at the international level. The biggest challenge 
is the fact that sources and expertise are fragmented across numerous institutions. EHRI is 
currently supported by two project consortia of 25 partners from Europe, Israel and the United States.

### EHRI-NL tries to perpetuate Holocaust research in the long term, both within the Netherlands and abroad, by:

 * representing archives, camps and other relevant collection management institutions and places of memory to enable and stimulate research
 * connecting sources, data, search aids and other research resources within a scientific infrastructure
 * to provide opportunities for training and exchange within an international network of researchers, archivists and heritage experts.

The impact of EHRI is primarily a scientific one. At the same time, the infrastructure aims
in a broader sense, to respond to the recent increase in anti-Semitism, xenophobia and aggression
nationalism in Europe and beyond. In the eyes of EHRI, Holocaust research is never an academic pursuit
in itself, but it is also a requirement for an open, non-discriminatory society.
